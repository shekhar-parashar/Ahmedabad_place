    <p>There are only a few places on earth which provide an environment filled with sheer excitement
      and tranquility at the same time. The Nandi Hills located near the city of Bangalore is one such
      paradise for every traveler around the world. The breathtaking view and the entire trekking experience
      that you get here is matchless and quite popular among the residents of the city and its surroundings.
      There are many stories about the origin of the name Nandi Hills. During the Chola period, Nandi Hills was called
      Anandagiri meaning The Hill of Happiness.[6] It is also perhaps called Nandi Hills because the hills resemble a
      sleeping bull. Another theory holds that the hill gets its name from an ancient, 1300-year-old, Dravidian-style
      temple, and for the Nandi (bull), statue situated on this hill.[citation needed]
